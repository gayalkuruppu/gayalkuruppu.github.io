- I am a research assistant at the Department of Computer Vision, [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/about/), UAE under Assistant Professor [Dr. Muhammad Haris Khan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZgERfFwAAAAJ&hl=en).

- I worked as a Software Engineer in the R&D team at WSO2. My work is related to the compiler of the novel cloud native programming language, [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io). Mainly, I develop Java backend APIs for language support such as completions, code-actions, hover, .. etc.

- I graduated from University of Moratuwa, Faculty of Engineering with a first class honours degree specializing in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering in 2021. I completed my thesis on "Virtual Try-on for Online Fashion" with [Dr. Ranga Rodrigo](https://ranga.staff.uom.lk). 

- I have completed my research internship in the Research team at WSO2, under the supervision of VP - Research & AI [Dr. Malith Jayasinghe](https://wso2.com/about/team/malith-jayasinghe/) and Senior VP & Chief Architect [Dr. Srinath Perera](https://wso2.com/about/team/srinath-perera/). I focused on analytically modeling the performance of the micro-services based systems.

- My research interests lies on "Computer Vision", "Performance Analysis", "Mathematical Modeling" and "Programming Languages".
